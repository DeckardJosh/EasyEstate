<h1>Easy Estate: Personal Project</h1>
<p>This is a project designed to showcase my skills as a developer. It is fully responsive. It uses mock real estate data to show houses in certain cities in Washington, such as Spokane, Seattle, Kennewick and more.</p>
<p><strong>Things to note:</strong></p>
<p>To cut back on having a large image assets folder, I used Lorem Picsum, for most of the database record images.</p>
<p>I have some features on this website disabled, inclucing the sign-up or log-in page/button, the contact page/button, and the request information section on the house preview page.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<p>I used PHP, Laravel, Livewire, MySQL, and some JS and CSS.</p>
<p>I also leveraged Bootstrap to speed up the process for a portion of the design.</p>

<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p>This project was designed, and based off of https://www.trulia.com/ where I tried to borrow proven design concepts, such as their hero, horozontal scroll, and card styles. I did not replicate the design completely as I wanted to take some liberties with what to add.</p>

<p><strong>Pages:</strong></p>
<p>There are 5 seperate pages for this project. Home, Buy, Rent, About, and another for showcasing a specific House.</p>

<p><strong>Home:</strong></p>
<p>The Home page pulls you in with a hero and a search bar, allowing you to search for a specific city in Washington. Note: there are only a few cities in washington that actually have data in the database.</p>
<p>The second section on the home page is the Section with the cities where there is mock data for houses being sold. Here you can click the view homes button which takes you to the search page where you can view all the homes in that specific city. This section also holds some mock user reviews.</p>
<p>The next section is the newly listed homes, where the newest homes added to the database are shown. This is shown in a horozontal scrolling container, with buttons on each side to scroll.</p>
<p>The fourth section are some quick links, to the buy, rent, and about page. </p>
<p>The second to last section is a quick search bar that functions exactly the same as the one in the hero, a search performed will take you to the search page.</p>
<p>The last section of course, is a footer with a colorful design.</p>

<p><strong>Buy:</strong></p>
<p>Here a list of all the homes in the database that are for "purchase" are shown. There are filters, which allow you to refine your results. There is also a search bar that will auto-update the results based on what city you are serching for.</p>
<p>These results are shown with a pagination of 12, allowing the server request to be minimal, as I am using Lorem Picsum for some of the photos shown in the design.</p>

<p><strong>Rent:</strong></p>
<p>This page functions the same as the buy page, except the cost is adjusted to be a monthly payment, and the results shown here are only houses that are for "rent".</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p>
<p>The about page talks about the mock company as a whole, with a simplistic yet engaging design.</p>

<p><strong>Individual House:</strong></p>
<p>This page showcases the individual house record and all of its data. Including the beds, baths, ac, garage and more.</p>

<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
<p>I had a blast on this project, as it had been a bit since I have worked with Laravel, or PHP. It was both challenging, and rewarding, and I look forward to updating the features, and design in the future. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions!</p>
